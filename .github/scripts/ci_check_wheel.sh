# This script checks a given Python wheel inside the `dist` is installable in a
# given Python version.
#
# It recieves the following arguments:
# - The python version to check, it must be compatible with uv.
# - A key value to allow searching for the wheel in the `dist` folder. Only a
#   single wheel in the folder must contain this value in its name.
#   Recommended values: abi3, cp314t, pypy39 and similar values.
# - (OPTIONAL) A single aditional flag to pass to `uv venv`.
#   Usually `--managed-python`.

# Any change made here should be made in `ci_check_wheel.ps1` too.
